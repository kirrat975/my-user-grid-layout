This is my 2nd task of LetsGrowMore internship of May 2022.In this task, we have to create a User card grid layout having a navbar showing any brand name 
 add a button in the navbar saying 'Get Users', which makes an API call to get the user data, use https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1 to get the data,show a loader while the API fetches the data. 
and use custom CSS/SASS/styled-components.
